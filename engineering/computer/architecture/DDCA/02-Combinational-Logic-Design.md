## 1 Introduction

+ [o] Element in circuit p.77
  + [o] wire (node in circuit)
    connects different gates
  + [o] input
    the wire connecting to the input, inputs can be denoted using
     $A_1, \cdots, A_n$
  + [o] output
    the wire connecting to the output, output can be denoted using
    other uppercase characters like $Y$, $X$ etc.
  + [o] internal
    wires connecting different gates, not connected to inputs or
    outputs
+ [o] Digital circuits classified as p.78
  + [o] **combinational**
    combine different gates as a circuit, and the output won't 
    affect the input.

    > A combinational circuit's output depend only on the current
    > values to compute the output. And it's memoryless

  + [o] **sequential**
    the output will be connected the inputs and affects inputs, the
    circuit is related to the time sequence

    > A sequential circuit's outputs depend on both current and
    > previous values of the inputs; it depends on the input
    > sequence. And it has memory

+ [o] Bus for simplify drawings using a single line with a slash
  through it p.78

## 2 Boolean Equations

+ [o] Terminology p.80
  + [o] **complement**
    Complement of TRUE is FALSE, and complement of FALSE is TRUE.
    If $A$ is a Boolean variable then its complement is denoted as
    $\overline{A}$
  + [o] **product** / **implicant** 
    Product of multiple Boolean variables is TRUE only all of these
    Boolean variables are TRUE, if one is FALSE then the result is
    FALSE. Product of $A_1, \cdots, A_n$ can be denoted as

    $$
        A_1 \cdot A_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot A_n
    $$

    + [o] **minterm**
      minterm is the a product of all Boolean variables like
      $A\overline{B}C$ is a minterm of input $A, B, C$
  + [o] **sum**
    Sum of multiple Boolean variables is FALSE only all of these
    Boolean variables are FALSE, if one is TRUE then the result is
    TRUE. Sum of $A_1, \cdots, A_n$ can be denoted as

    $$
        A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_n
    $$

    + [o] **maxterm**
      Similarly, maxterm is the sum of all Boolean variables (or
      its complement) like $A + \overline{B} + \overline{C}$ is a
      maxterm of input $A, B, C$
  + [o] precedence of these operations
    NOT > AND > OR
+ [o] **Sum-of-Products Form** p.81
  + [o] what is sigma notation $F(A_1, \cdots, A_n) = \Sigma(m_0, \cdots, m_{n - 1})$ 
    The notation can be viewed as a binary representation, for
    example for minterm $m_3$ of two Boolean variables $A, B$
    can be written as $AB$. **In sigma notation, $A$ represents
    $1$ and its complement $\overline{A}$ represents $0$**.
+ [o] **Product-of-Sums Form** p.82
  + [o] what is pi notation $F(A_1, \cdots, A_n) = \Pi(M_0, \cdots, M_{n - 1})$ 
    The notation can also be viewed as a binary representation, for
    example for maxterm $M_2$ of two Boolean variables $A, B$ can be
    written as $\overline{A} + \overline{B}$. **In pi notation, $A$
    represents $0$ and its complement $\overline{A}$ represents $1$**.

+ [o] Theorems of Several Variables with their duality p.84
  + [o] **commutativity** $T_6$: $A + B = B + A$ and $A \cdot B = B \cdot A$
  + [o] **associativity** $T_7$: $A \cdot (B \cdot C) = (A \cdot B) \cdot C$ and $A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C$
  + [o] **distributivity** $T_8$: $A \cdot (B + C) = A \cdot B + A \cdot C$ and $A + (B \cdot C) = (A + C) \cdot (A + B)$
  + [o] **covering** $T_9$: $B \cdot (B + C) = B$ and $B + (B \cdot C) = B$
  + [o] **combining** $T_{10}$: $B \cdot C + B \cdot \overline{C} = B$ and $(B + C) \cdot (B + \overline{C}) = B$
  + [o] **consensus** $T_{11}$: $B \cdot C + \overline{B} \cdot D + C \cdot D = B \cdot C + \overline{B} \cdot D$ and $(B + C) \cdot (\overline{B} + D) \cdot (C + D) = (B + C) \cdot (\overline{B} + D)$
  + [o] **De Morgan's** $T_{12}$:
    + $\overline{B_0 \cdot B_1 \cdots} = \overline{B_0} + \overline{B_1} + \cdots$
    + $\overline{B_0 + B_1 + \cdots} = \overline{B_0} \cdot \overline{B_1} \cdots$

  Like $Y = A\overline{B} + BC$
  > We define an equation in sum-of-products form to be minimized
  > if it uses the fewest possible implicants. If there are several
  > equations with the same number of implicants, the minimal one is
  > the one with the fewest literal.
+ [?] prime implicant
  > The prime implicant cannot be combined with any other implicants
  > in the equation to form a new implicant with fewer literals
+ [o] N-input XOR p.92
  The output of N-input XOR is TRUE when there are odd numbers of
  value of inputs are TRUE. It's FALSE when there are even numbers
  of value of inputs are TRUE
+ [o] **bubble pushing** p.94
  derived from De Morgan's theorem 
  and it says that a NOR gate equals to two INV gates and an and
  gate. The inversion circles bubble from output to inputs

    </div>

    > The **tristate buffer** has three possible output state:
    > HIGH(1), LOW(0) and floating(Z). The tristate buffer has
    > an input A output Y and **enable** E. When the enable is
    > TRUE, the tristate buffer acts like normal buffer. When
    > the enable is FALSE, the tristate buffer acts not like
    > a part of the circuit.

## 4 Karnaugh Maps

+ [i] The order of karnaugh maps columns p.98
  In gray code order of **high digits**, only change for one bit:
  `00 -> 01 -> 11 -> 11`
  `000 -> 001 -> 011 -> 010 -> 110 -> 111 -> 101 -> 100`
+ [i] The order of karnaugh maps rows p.98
  In gray code order of **low digits**, only change for one bit
+ [ ] **How to draw karnaugh maps and find the minimized expression**
  1. Use the fewest circles necessary to cover all the $1$'s
  2. All the squares in each circle must contain $1$'s
  3. Each circle must span a rectangular block that is the power
    of $2$ like $1, 2, 4, 8$ squares in **each direction**
  4. Each circle should be as large as possible
