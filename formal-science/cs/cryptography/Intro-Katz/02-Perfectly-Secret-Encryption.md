+ [o] Modern random-number generation
  + First, a pool of high-entropy data is collected
  + This high-entropy data is processed to yield a sequence of
    nearly independent and unbiased bits.

    > For example, our high-entropy data results from a sequence of
    > biased coin flips, "heads" occurs with probability $p$ and
    > "tails" occurs with probability $1 - p$. It's random and high-
    > entropy but not uniform. We can output `0` when a head is
    > followed by a tail and output `1` when a tail is followed by 
    > head so their probabilities are both $p(1- p)$

  + One should use a random-number generator that **is designed for
    cryptographic use**, rather than a general-purpose random-
    generator (like `rand()` function in `stdlib.h` of C)
  + The key-generation algorithm $\mathsf{Gen}$ is a probability
    algorithm that outputs a key $k$ chosen according to some
    distribution. We denote by $\mathcal{K}$ the finite key space,
    the set of all possible keys generated by $\mathsf{Gen}$.
  + The encryption algorithm $\mathsf{Enc}$ takes as input a key
    $k \in \mathcal{K}$ and a message $m \in \mathcal{M}$, and outputs
    a ciphertext $c$. If we allow the encryption algorithm to be
    probabilistic, $\mathsf{Enc}_k(m)$ might output a different
    ciphertext when run multiple times, and we write

    $$
      c \leftarrow \mathsf{Enc}_k(m)
    $$

    In case $\mathsf{Enc}$ is deterministic, we may emphasize this by
    writing $c := \mathsf{Enc}_k(m)$
  + [o] We let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of all possible ciphertext
    can be output by $\mathsf{Enc}_k(m)$ for all possible choice of
    $k \in \mathcal{K}$ and $m \in \mathcal{M}$ and for all random choice
    of $\mathsf{Enc}$ in case it is randomized.
  + [ ] **perfect correctness**
  + [o] We let $K$ be a random variable denoting the value of the key
    output by $\mathsf{Gen}$, thus for any $k \in \mathcal{K}$, we use
    $\mathbb{P}[K=k]$ to denote the probability that the key output
    by $\mathsf{Gen}$ is equal to $k$
  + [o] Similarly, $\mathbb{P}[M=m]$ and $\mathbb{P}[C=c]$
