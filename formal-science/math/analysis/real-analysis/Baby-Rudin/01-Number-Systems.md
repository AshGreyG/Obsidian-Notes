## 1 Introduction

+ [ ] Prove that the equation $p ^ 2 = 2$ cannot be satisfied any
  rational $p$.
+ [ ] Show that let $A$ be the set of all positive rationals $p$ that
  $p ^ 2 < 2$ and let $B$ be the set of all positive rationals $p$
  that $p ^ 2 > 2$, **$A$ contains no largest number and $B$ contains
  no smallest**.
+ [ ] **order**
+ [ ] ordered sets
+ [ ] **upper bound** and **lower bound**
  + [ ] **least upper bound** / **supremum**, $\alpha = \sup E$
  + [ ] **greatest lower bound** / **infimum**, $\alpha = \inf E$
  + [ ] **least-upper-bound property**
+ [ ] Prove theorem:

  > Suppose $S$ in an ordered set with the least-upper-bound 
  > property, $B \subset S$ and $B$ is not empty, and $B$
  > is bounded below. Let $L$ be the set of all lower bounds of $B$.
  > Then $\alpha = \sup L$ exists in $S$ and $\alpha = \inf B$. In
